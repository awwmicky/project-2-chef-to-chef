## Summary of App: 

We want to make a personal chef web app, which allows skillful Cooks to sign up as a Personal Chef and do catering for users' in the Bay Area.

Users can go to the site to view Personal Chefs around their area & select the chef to cater their meal. Then after the meal has been made, the User can review them.


## Minimum Requirement for our App: 

- Build database for chef profiles
- users login and use POST and GET to add or update database.


## Bonuses for the App: 

We can expand on it by adding a sign up feature for both users and chefs in separate html pages.

Also, we can link recipes with chef's specialities.
